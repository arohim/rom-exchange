# ROM Exchange

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ We hope this boilerplate is not only helpful to other developers, but also that it helps to educate in the area of architecture. We created this boilerplate for a few reasons:

1. To experiment with modularisation
2. To share some approaches to clean architecture, especially as we've been [talking a lot about it](https://academy.realm.io/posts/converting-an-app-to-use-clean-architecture/)
3. To use as a starting point in future projects where clean architecture feels appropriate

It is written 100% in Kotlin with both UI and Unit tests - we will also be keeping this up-to-date as libraries change!
