# About this project
This is what I make for POC about Android Clean Architecture Modular pattern for my team, while POC I want to make a simple project to see how it goes what the problem we will found when we using this boiler plate, it's complecate at first but it has a reason of each part 

Our project have 48 features using Clean Architecture already in a single module very slow build, big code base and hard to maintain and we planned to have Instant App and Dynamic Delivery in the future a lot of thing to do, after POC our code base is modular already, common and base module was splitted out, but still big in the base module we need some time to refactor it, start with remote, cache and data layers first.
